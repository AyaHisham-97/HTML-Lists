                    <p>With a play opening on Broadway, and every reason to smile, Sarah Ruhl has just survived a
                        high-risk pregnancy when she discovers the left side of her face is completely paralyzed. She is
                        assured that 90 percent of Bell’s palsy patients experience a full recovery—like Ruhl’s own
                        mother. But Sarah is in the unlucky ten percent. And for a woman, wife, mother, and artist
                        working in theater, the paralysis and the disconnect between the interior and exterior brings
                        significant and specific challenges. So Ruhl begins an intense decade-long search for a cure
                        while simultaneously grappling with the reality of her new face—one that, while recognizably her
                        own—is incapable of accurately communicating feelings or intentions.

                <li>
                    <p>In a series of piercing, profound, and lucid meditations, Ruhl chronicles her journey as a
                        patient, wife, mother, and artist. She explores the struggle of a body yearning to match its
                        inner landscape, the pain of postpartum depression, the story of a marriage, being a playwright
                        and working mom to three small children, and the desire for a resilient spiritual life in the
                        face of illness.

                        An intimate and “stunning” (Publishers Weekly, starred review) examination of loss and
                        reconciliation, “Ruhl reminds us that a smile is not just a smile but a vital form of
                        communication, of bonding, of what makes us human” (The Washington Post). Brimming with insight,
                        humility, and levity, Smile is a triumph by one of America’s leading playwrights.</p>
