                    <p>Eric Berne introduces us to his own concept of transactional analysis-an integrated approach of
                        psychology and psychotherapy in the first half of the book. This concept holds elements such as
                        psychoanalysis, cognizance and humanism in its approach. Berne describes the roles of humans in
                        three categories: the parent, the adult and the child. He argues that upon confusing or
                        switching one's role, there can be emerging of negative traits. In the second half of the book,
                        the author explains a series of mind games people play with each other-knowingly or
                        unknowingly-in their interactions. These mind games, according to burne, is shallow and
                        predictable. Berne discusses the patterns in which these mind games appear. Revolutionizing the
                        thoughts of people from the time of its release, the book is one of the original and knowledge
                        psychology books written. The edition is published in paperback, on 7 January 2010. Key features
                        this is one of the earliest psychological books, first released in 1964. The book has sold more
                        than five million copies worldwide.</p>
