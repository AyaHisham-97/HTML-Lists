                    <p>Will Sawyer, a Marine veteran turned FBI Hostage Rescue Team leader, loses his left leg below the
                        knee when he and HRT colleague Ben Gillespie encounter a hostage taker with a suicide bomb.
                        Ten years later, Sawyer is a private security consultant who, on a recommendation from
                        Gillespie, is hired to review security for the world’s tallest skyscraper, Hong Kong’s 3,500
                        feet (1,060 meter), 225 floor tower, "The Pearl", for owner Zhao Long Ji. Sawyer is joined by
                        his wife, Sarah, and twin children, Georgia and Henry, staying with him on the not-yet-opened
                        residential floors. Sawyer meets with Zhao, Gillespie, security director Okeke and head
                        insurance underwriter Pierce, to report that the computerized fire and security systems have
                        passed his tests, though he needs to inspect the offsite security center. Zhao provides him with
                        a tablet that gives Sawyer complete control over the Pearl’s systems. Sawyer and Gillespie head
                        to the offsite facility, but a thief hired by international terrorist Kores Botha attempts to
                        steal the tablet. Gillespie reveals he is also working for Botha and attacks Sawyer for the
                        tablet, ending with Gillespie’s death.

                    <p>Inspector Wu leads the local police to secure the Pearl and capture Sawyer, who is believed to be
                        behind the incidents. Sawyer evades them and makes his way into the Pearl above the fire barrier
                        using a crane from an adjacent building. Sawyer kills Pierce before Pierce can kill Sawyer's
                        family, though Georgia is separated from the others. Sawyer has Sarah and Henry ride through the
                        fire barrier in a free-fall elevator before applying the emergency brakes, letting them escape
                        safely; Sarah immediately explains the situation to Wu and that Botha's men will likely escape
                        via parachute to a nearby landing zone. Sawyer searches for Georgia, and after finding her they
                        are captured by Botha, who demands Zhao in return for Georgia. Sawyer is forced to dangerously
                        scale the outside of the building to access the security panel for Zhao's penthouse, then enters
                        and confronts Zhao. Zhao explains that Botha had extorted money from him during the $6 billion
                        construction project, but Zhao kept a detailed computer file of the transactions, which can
                        reveal accounts and names of three crime syndicates Botha works for; Botha instigated the attack
                        to obtain the records.

                    <p>Sawyer brings Zhao to Botha at the top of the skyscraper, acquiescing to the trade for Georgia.
                        However, Zhao distracts Botha, allowing Sawyer and Zhao to kill Botha's thugs. Botha grabs
                        Georgia and threatens to drop her off the building, but Sawyer beats him, rescues Georgia, and
                        lets Botha die in a grenade explosion as he falls. Wu leads an attack on the likely dropzone,
                        securing Xia and killing her thugs. Sarah recovers the tablet and uses it to restart the Pearl’s
                        systems, extinguishing the blaze. Sawyer, Georgia, and Zhao are brought down safely by
                        helicopter, and the Sawyer family happily reunites while Wu acknowledges and finally meets and
                        greets Sawyer. Zhao states his intention to rebuild the Pearl, shown to have massive fire damage
                        extending from the 96th floor to the roof.
