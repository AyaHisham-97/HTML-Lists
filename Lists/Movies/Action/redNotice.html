                    <p>During the 20th century BC, Roman general Mark Antony gifts Egyptian queen Cleopatra three
                        bejeweled eggs as a wedding gift to show his devotion. The eggs are lost in time until two are
                        found by a farmer in 1907, but the last one remains lost.
                        In the present day, John Hartley, who is a criminal profiler for the FBI is assigned to assist
                        Interpol agent Urvashi Das in investigating the potential theft of one of the eggs on display at
                        the Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome. The head of security dismisses the concerns,
                        but Hartley reveals the egg is a forgery and the real egg has been stolen.

                <li>
                    <p>The next day, Das confronts Hartley and has him incarcerated in a remote Russian prison in the
                        same cell as Booth, believing he's responsible for the theft. Shortly after arrival, Black
                        proposes that Booth work with her to find the third egg as he knows about its whereabouts. Booth
                        declines her modest offer, so Hartley suggests they work together to defeat her. If Booth helps
                        him imprison her, Booth will be the number one art thief in the world.

                    <p>The pair escapes from prison, heading to Valencia to steal the second egg, in possession of
                        notorious arms dealer Sotto Voce who is having a masquerade ball. There, they find Black, who is
                        also there to steal it. The three arrive in Voce's vault where Hartley and Booth fight Black.
                        Voce arrives with his security detail while Black reveals she is working with Voce. They torture
                        Hartley until Booth reveals the location of the third egg.
                        Black betrays Voce and leaves for Egypt where Booth claims it is. After leaving Valencia, Booth
                        reveals to Hartley that the egg is actually in Argentina, a location only he knows as it was
                        inscribed on his late father's beloved watch which had once belonged to Adolf Hitler's personal
                        art curator Rudolph Zeich. They search the jungle, to find a secret bunker, full of countless
                        Nazi artifacts, including the third egg.

                    <p>Booth surrenders the egg and they leave him handcuffed. In Cairo, Hartley and Black deliver the
                        three eggs to an Egyptian billionaire, in time for his daughter's wedding although she is more
                        excited for the wedding singer Ed Sheeran. The wedding is subsequently interrupted by an
                        Interpol raid by Das, who arrest the billionaire, his daughter, and Sheeran.
                        Six months later, Hartley and Black are met again by Booth in Sardinia, who informs them that he
                        told Das about their Cayman Islands account containing the $300 million payout, which Das
                        freezes leaving them with no money. Booth also reveals that Interpol is on their way to capture
                        them, but offers a chance to escape if they help him with a new heist, which requires three
                        individuals to pull off. They agree and escape, where Das places red notices on all three of
                        them as they begin their heist at the Louvre.
