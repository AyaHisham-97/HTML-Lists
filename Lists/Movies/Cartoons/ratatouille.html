                    <p>Remy, a young rat with a perfect sense of taste and smell, dreams of becoming a chef like his
                        idol, the late Auguste Gusteau. The rest of his colony, including his brother Émile and his
                        father, the clan leader Django, are interested in food only for sustenance. The rats live in the
                        attic of an elderly woman's house outside Paris. After Remy and Émile accidentally reveal the
                        colony to the woman, they are forced to flee and Remy becomes separated from the others in the
                        sewer. Encouraged by an imaginary Gusteau, he eventually finds himself above the kitchen of
                        Gusteau's restaurant.

                    <p>Remy notices the restaurant's new garbage boy, Alfredo Linguini, attempting to fix a soup he
                        ruined, and jumps in to fix Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy in the act, but does not
                        reveal him to Skinner, Gusteau's former sous-chef and the new owner of the restaurant. Skinner
                        confronts Linguini for tampering with the soup, but when the soup is accidentally served and
                        proves to be a success, Colette Tatou, the restaurant's only female chef, convinces Skinner to
                        retain Linguini to uphold Gusteau's motto, "Anyone can cook". Skinner demands Linguini replicate
                        the soup to keep his job. Skinner spots Remy and orders Linguini to take him outside and kill
                        him. Once they're alone, Linguini discovers that Remy can understand him, and he convinces Remy
                        to help him cook at the restaurant.

                    <p>Meanwhile, Skinner discovers from a letter from Linguini's recently deceased mother that Linguini
                        is Gusteau's illegitimate son and the rightful owner of the restaurant. The revelation threatens
                        Skinner's ownership, as Gusteau's will stated that he would inherit the restaurant only if no
                        biological heir appeared within two years of Gusteau's death. After Skinner's attorney verifies
                        Linguini is Gusteau's heir, Skinner hides the letter and the will. Remy finds them and is chased
                        by Skinner, but Remy outruns him and shows the documents to Linguini, who then forces Skinner
                        out. The restaurant thrives as Remy's recipes become popular; Linguini's life improves and he
                        develops a romantic relationship with Colette.

                    <p>The next day, Remy is captured by Skinner but promptly freed by Django and Émile. Linguini
                        reconciles with Remy and reveals the truth to his staff, who all quit. Having been reminded of
                        Gusteau's motto, Colette returns to help. Django and the clan assist, cooking under Remy's
                        direction while Linguini waits tables. Skinner and a health inspector attempt to interfere, but
                        get locked in the pantry. Remy creates a variation of ratatouille which reminds the astounded
                        Ego of his mother's cooking. Asking to meet the chef, he is told to wait until the restaurant is
                        empty. Ego is stunned upon being introduced to Remy. The next day, he writes a review by stating
                        that he has come to understand Gusteau's motto, and describes Remy — without revealing that he
                        is a rat — as "nothing less than the finest chef in France."
