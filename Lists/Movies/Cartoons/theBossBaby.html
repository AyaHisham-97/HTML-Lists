                        <p>Timothy "Tim" Templeton, an imaginative 7-year-old boy, relishes his parents' attention and
                            is horrified when a new baby brother arrives. Boss Baby, whom he first saw arriving in a
                            taxi, clad in suit and tie, and carrying a briefcase, behaves normally around the adults,
                            crying for attention and food and diapers all day and night. However, Tim, quickly growing
                            jealous, sees Baby behaving and talking like an adult whenever his parents aren't looking.

                        <p>Baby is taken back to Baby Corp and promoted to CEO. Some Baby Corp employees enter Tim's
                            house, where they remove evidence of Baby, and make his parents forget about him while they
                            are sleeping. One of them asks Tim if he would like to forget too, but he declines. Baby and
                            Tim miss each other terribly, and Tim finally invites Baby back, saying if there is only
                            love enough for one of them, Baby can have it all. Realizing that love is something that
                            grows, instead of being split, Baby returns, this time as a normal infant boy named Theodore
                            "Ted" Templeton.

                            with his wife Carol and their two daughters, 7 years old Tabitha and infant Tina. Tim's

                            gives them both magic pacifiers to visit BabyCorp. Tina introduces the brothers to a new
                            formula that will allow them to turn back into children for 48 hours in order to go
                            undercover to Tabitha's school and figure out what Dr. Erwin Armstrong, founder and
                            principal of the school, is planning behind parents' back.
