                    <p>Aladdin, an orphaned street urchin in the Arabian city of Agrabah, and his monkey Abu meet
                        Princess
                        Jasmine, who has snuck away from her sheltered life in the palace. Jasmine wishes to succeed her
                        father as Sultan, but is instead expected to marry one of her royal suitors, including the
                        charming
                        yet dimwitted Prince Anders. Jafar, the grand vizier, schemes to overthrow the Sultan and seeks
                        a
                        magic lamp hidden in the Cave of Wonders, but only "the diamond in the rough" can enter the
                        cave.

                <li>
                    <p>Jafar's pet parrot Iago spots Aladdin and Abu sneaking into the royal palace and visiting
                        Jasmine. Aladdin is then captured by Jafar. He offers to make Aladdin rich enough to impress
                        Jasmine in exchange for retrieving the lamp, and warns him to take nothing else. Inside the
                        cave, Aladdin frees a magic carpet and finds the lamp, but Abu cannot resist touching some
                        treasure and causes the cave to collapse. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, who double crosses
                        and kicks him and Abu into the cave, but Abu steals the lamp back.

                    <p>Trapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning the omnipotent Genie inside,
                        who explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin gets them out of the
                        cave without using a wish on a technicality: he did not rub the lamp in the first place as he
                        stated the wish. Determined to woo Jasmine, he uses his official first wish to become a prince,
                        and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude and turn him human.

                    <p>Freed by Iago, Jafar steals the lamp and becomes the Genie's new master. He uses his first wish
                        to become sultan, but Jasmine reminds the palace guards of their true loyalty, turning them
                        against Jafar. Using his second wish to become the world's most powerful sorcerer, Jafar exposes
                        Aladdin, exiles him and Abu to a frozen wasteland, imprisons the palace guards and Jasmine's pet
                        tiger Rajah, and then threatens to kill the Sultan and Dalia unless Jasmine agrees to marry him.
                        At the wedding, Jasmine rescues the lamp from Jafar and jumps into the magic carpet to escape
                        with Aladdin and Abu, who had been rescued from the frozen wasteland by the magic carpet, after
                        the Genie sent it behind Jafar's back. Chased by Iago, whom Jafar briefly transformed into a
                        roc, and Jafar using a thunderstorm and sand twister, Aladdin and Jasmine are recaptured and the
                        magic carpet is destroyed.
