                    <p>Maleficent is a powerful fairy living in the Moors, a magical forest realm bordering a human
                        kingdom. As a young girl, Maleficent meets and falls in love with a human peasant boy named
                        Stefan. On Maleficent's 16th birthday, he gives her what he calls a true love's kiss. However,
                        as they grow older, the two grow apart; Stefan's love is overshadowed by his ambition to be
                        king, and Maleficent becomes protector of the Moors.

                    <p>When King Henry tries to conquer the Moors, Maleficent mortally wounds him, forcing his retreat.
                        As he lies dying, he declares that whoever kills Maleficent will be named his successor and
                        marry his daughter. Stefan calls on Maleficent in the Moors; he drugs her, but cannot bring
                        himself to kill her. Instead, he amputates her wings, presents them to Henry as 'proof' of
                        Maleficent's death, and is named the new King. While still processing the betrayal, Maleficent
                        turns Diaval, a trapped raven, into a human, frightening away his captors. He promises to serve
                        her, and brings her news of the humans. Infuriated when she learns why her wings were taken,
                        Maleficent, and the Moors she controls, become dark and sinister.

                    <p>On the day before Aurora's 16th birthday, Aurora tells Maleficent that she would like to live
                        with her in the Moors. When she informs the Pixies of this, they reveal the truth about Aurora's
                        lineage and the curse. Angrily accusing Maleficent of being evil, Aurora runs to her father's
                        castle. Instead of welcoming Aurora, Stefan locks her in a room while plotting to kill
                        Maleficent. The curse's power draws Aurora to the dungeon, where she pricks her finger on a
                        spindle and falls into a deep sleep. Maleficent, intent on saving her, abducts Phillip and
                        infiltrates Stefan's castle. The pixies encourage the reluctant Phillip to kiss Aurora, but this
                        does not wake her. After Philip leaves, Maleficent tearfully apologizes to Aurora and kisses her
                        on the forehead. This unexpectedly awakens Aurora, as Maleficent truly feels maternal love for
                        her.

                    <p>As Maleficent and Aurora attempt to leave, Stefan and his guards ambush them. Maleficent
                        transforms Diaval into a dragon to help her and Aurora, but both are subdued. Meanwhile, Aurora
                        finds Maleficent's caged wings and releases them. They fly to Maleficent and reattach
                        themselves, but Stefan continues fighting. Maleficent carries him to the top of the highest
                        tower; unwilling to kill him, she announces the fight is over and tries to leave him there. He
                        tackles her from behind, dragging them both off the tower. Maleficent opens her wings to save
                        herself, causing Stefan to lose hold and fall to his death. With King Stefan gone, Maleficent
                        returns the Moors to its former glory, and gives away her position to Aurora, who is crowned
                        queen of the Moors, uniting the two kingdoms. Phillip also comes to visit them.
