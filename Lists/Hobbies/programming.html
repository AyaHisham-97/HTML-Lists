                <li><strong>Coding</strong> is something that makes a difference. When you code, you get this feeling
                    that you are helping people. Through code you can create something that people interact with, use, touch and work with.
                    When you manage to build something that solves problems, you know that you are making a difference in someone
                    else's life. That is an amazing feeling.</li>

                <li><strong>Team work</strong> The community of software developers is much closer knit than most
                    professions. There are plenty meetups and networking events for every niche of programming. There is also a huge community
                    that supports programmers online, so you never code alone. Beside that working as a developer you can
                    actually involve a great deal of interaction with others across the business. That includes
                    designers,managers, clients and users. These people usually have a different viewpoint on programming which in
                    some cases annoys the programmer. But let's stay positive, experience working in a team is 
                    invaluable as it helps you to become more versatile as a professional, therefore more valuable as an employee.
                    Besides that you can also find a lot of inspiration coming out from a non-technical level. Last but not
                    least,coding as a career has no boundaries and knows no countries, therefore programmers are usually
                    surrounded by international folks. Which is -- now I am talking from my own experience -- pretty
                    amazing!</li>

                <li><strong>Problem solving</strong> The sense of accomplishment when solving a really complicated
                    problem
                    cannot be beaten. There are always new problems to solve, solutions to find and bugs to fix. The
                    non-repeating nature of the subject implies that each new challenge you solve will teach you
                    something new in return and make you a better programmer.</li>

                <li><strong>Challenge</strong> Many aspects of programming are challenging. Building up requirements,
                    designing clear and scalable systems, writing efficient code and debugging in a multi-threaded
                    environment are not easy tasks. Surprisingly, mental challenges are one of the things that excites
                    Barcelona Code School students the most. Programming languages have strict logic that you must
                    comply with at all times, but there is almost an infinite number of ways to write a program to solve given problem.</li>
