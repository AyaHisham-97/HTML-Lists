                    <li><strong>It helps me to overcome my depression.</strong> </li>
                    <p>I have a depression. Depression is a severe illness for me because it may cause death. Some may
                        say that depression is just a joke or a drama of the person who's having it. Treating it is
                        costly so I have to find an alternative solution to overcome it. Then there's music. Everytime
                        my depression visits me, I have just to listen to music or to my favorite songs to be specific.
                        After listening I just have to do three deep breaths and then eventually my depression would be
                        gone.

                    <li><strong>Music is my great comforter.</strong> </li>
                    <p>There is one time that I am so down that I cried all night. Then there's music, it never left me.
                        I just listened to it and then started thinking positively. I didn't realized I am already
                        smiling. When no one is there for me to comfort me, I will just get my earphones and then listen
                        to music. Second by second, minute by minute, I forgot my worries and negative thoughts. Music
                        is just a great comforter to me.</p>

                    <li><strong>It helps me to have more focus on something.</strong> </li>
                    <p>Sometimes when I have many things to do, I can't focus on one thing. My mind is struggling. If I
                        am not focused I can't do my best on that thing. So there's one time that I have many things to
                        do. I am out of focus because I am thinking about what to do first. So I listened to music. I
                        didn't know that I was so focused that I finished all my works on time beautifully. So everytime
                        I have things to do. I just turn up the music and start doing it.</p>

                    <li><strong>When I can't express my feelings, there's music to help me express it.</strong> </li>
                    <p>There's a time in our lives that we just can't express our feelings to ourselves and to everyone.
                        Whether we are sad, happy, or angry. I have that time too. When I got broken, I can't speak. I
                        cried and cried. Until I see my guitar in the corner of my room. I get it and start strumming
                        it. I sang my feelings out. It helped me to be calm and to move on. Until then, I used music as
                        a language when I can't express my feelings.</p>

                    <li><strong> It serves as a foundation of my family.</strong> </li>
                    <p>Since my family is musically inclined, our bonding time is through music. Without music, we may
                        not able to communicate to each other personally. I am glad and very thankful that God has given
                        me a precious gift, my family. I may not have a perfect family but if we sing together we will
                        produce a perfect harmony.</p>
