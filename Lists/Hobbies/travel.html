    <h1>Here’s what travel means to me…</h1>
    <font size="+2">
        <p>
            For me personally, travel is a way of life. I was born into a
            travel-obsessed family and had already lived on three different
            continents by the time I started school, so wanderlust (and an often
            ridiculed hybrid accent) was inevitable for me. My sister and I are
            incredibly fortunate to have parents that insisted that travel was the
            best classroom and, thankfully, our school holidays were spent exploring
            fascinating places, both near and far. Upon graduating university (and
            turning 21), I was given the greatest gift: the gift of travel. Armed
            with a round-the-world plane ticket and a sense of adventure, I took off
            on a six-month solo backpacking trip through Europe, Southern Africa and
            Australia and, without a doubt, it changed the way I saw the world. So,
            as a self-confessed travel addict, here are the 10 reasons why I love to
            travel.

                Travel exposes us to different cultures and ancient traditions and
                through these authentic encounters, we learn to embrace and celebrate
                both our similarities and our differences. Travel teaches us about
                humanity and gives us an appreciation, understanding and respect for
                different points of view and ways of life.
