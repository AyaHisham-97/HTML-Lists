                        <li>It’s fun.</li>
                    </strong>
                    <p>I love that cooking give me a chance to be creative and indulge in some ‘play’ time – something
                        we adults could do with a lot more. I adore losing myself in the rituals of chopping, stirring
                        and tasting.</p>

                    <strong>
                        <li>It’s delicious.</li>
                    </strong>
                    <p>When you’re cooking you get to choose what you make AND what goes into each dish. You also get to
                        choose the quality of the ingredients. So it’s easy to make things that are the most delicious
                        to you.</p>

                    <strong>
                        <li>It’s good for your body.</li>
                    </strong>
                    <p>The more I learn about nutrition the more I’ve come to realize that the most important factor for
                        healthy eating is to avoid processed food and focus on using real ingredients.
                        And the best way to do this? Cook for yourself as much as you can.</p>

                    <strong>
                        <li>It’s good for the soul. </li>
                    </strong>
                    <p>Spending 30 minutes in the kitchen preparing dinner will put me in a much calmer, less frazzled
                        mood than sitting on the couch for the same amount of time.
                        Plus it gives me an opportunity to nurture my family and friends. To express my love and take
                        care of them.</p>

                    <strong>
                        <li>The praise! </li>
                    </strong>
                    <p>As much as I’d like to think that all these lofty benefits were what first got me into cooking,
                        really, it was the praise.
                        Hearing the words ‘this is amazing’ was a huge motivator for me to keep spending time in the
                        kitchen when I was learning to cook.
                        And still is.</p>
